# Hi 👋 I'm Ata

Junior Full Stack Developer (Backend-oriented)

I build backend-focused web applications using Node.js and PostgreSQL.
I have real-world experience developing secure, scalable internal systems used in institutional environments.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 Computer Programming graduate (2-year degree)
- 💼 Working as a Software Support Specialist in a public institution
- 🏛️ Developed and deployed internal web systems used by real users, handling authentication, roles and data integrity
- 🔐 Focused on backend development, security and database design
- 🚀 Currently improving my React skills to strengthen my frontend side

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (actively learning & building full stack projects)

**Backend**
- Node.js (Express)
- RESTful APIs
- Authentication & Authorization (JWT, Sessions)
- Secure API design

**Database**
- PostgreSQL (schema design, relations, queries)

**Tools & Others**
- Git & GitHub
- Environment Variables (.env)
- Basic deployment & environment configuration

## 🧠 Project Approach

I focus on:
- Clean and maintainable code
- Secure backend architecture
- Proper separation of concerns
- Real-world problem solving
- Designing systems with maintainability and future scaling in mind

Most of my professional projects are internal institutional systems,
so the repositories here are personal projects built to showcase my skills and architecture decisions.

## 📌 Featured Projects

🚧 New projects are currently under development.

I am building backend-heavy full stack applications focused on:
- authentication & authorization
- role-based access control
- clean architecture
- PostgreSQL data modeling

They will be published here as public showcase projects.

## 🎯 Currently Focusing On

- Deepening my knowledge in Node.js and backend architecture
- Building full stack projects with React & Node.js
